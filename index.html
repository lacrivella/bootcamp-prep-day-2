        <p>If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. A happy cloud. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. It's important to me that you're happy. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Happy painting, God bless. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. See there how easy that is.</p>
